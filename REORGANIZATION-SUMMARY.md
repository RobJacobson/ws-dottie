# Endpoint Code Reorganization Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully reorganized all endpoint-related code from scattered locations into a consolidated `src/shared/endpoints/` directory structure.

## Files Moved

### From `src/shared/` to `src/shared/endpoints/`:
- `endpoint.ts` → `endpoints/endpoint.ts`
- `endpoints.ts` → `endpoints/index.ts` 
- `utils/endpointDiscovery.ts` → `endpoints/endpointDiscovery.ts`

## Import Updates

Updated **116 files** across the codebase to use the new import paths:

### Before:
```typescript
import type { Endpoint } from "@/shared/endpoint";
import { findEndpointByFunctionName } from "@/shared/endpoints";
import { isEndpoint } from "@/shared/utils/endpointDiscovery";
```

### After:
```typescript
import type { Endpoint } from "@/shared/endpoints";
import { findEndpointByFunctionName } from "@/shared/endpoints";
import { isEndpoint } from "@/shared/endpoints/endpointDiscovery";
```

## Updated Files Include:
- All client endpoint definitions (90+ files)
- CLI modules (3 files)
- E2E test generators (2 files)
- Shared utilities and other components

## New Directory Structure

```
src/shared/endpoints/
├── endpoint.ts              # Core endpoint types and defineEndpoint factory
├── endpointDiscovery.ts     # Shared discovery utilities
└── index.ts                 # Main registry and barrel exports
```

## Verification

✅ **All tests pass**: E2E discovery tests (22/22 passing)  
✅ **CLI functionality works**: Help, function listing, and actual API calls  
✅ **No broken imports**: All 116 files updated successfully  
✅ **Shared utilities preserved**: Both CLI and test systems use common discovery code  

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: All endpoint-related code in one logical location
2. **Cleaner Imports**: Consistent import paths across the codebase
3. **Maintained Functionality**: Zero breaking changes to existing features
4. **Shared Architecture**: Common utilities eliminate code duplication
5. **Future-Proof**: Clear structure for adding new endpoint-related features

## Impact

- **Zero downtime**: All functionality preserved during reorganization
- **Improved maintainability**: Easier to find and modify endpoint-related code
- **Better separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between endpoint logic and other shared utilities
- **Enhanced developer experience**: More intuitive file organization and import paths

The reorganization was completed successfully with no functional changes to the codebase while significantly improving code organization and maintainability.

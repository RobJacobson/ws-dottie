# API Documentation Enhancement - Master Overview

## Project Mission

Transform terse, generic API descriptions into rich, semantic documentation that explains business purpose, real-world meaning, and endpoint relationships. Create discoverable documentation that enables both human developers and AI agents to understand and effectively use Washington State transportation APIs.

## Agent Assignment Structure

### Work Model: Siloed Independence
- Agents work independently unless specifically instructed otherwise
- No coordination or collaboration between agents during development
- Agents may be asked to compare/critique work after completion

### Assignment Options
- **Single Agent**: Complete ownership of entire API
- **Multiple Agents**: Each agent works on complete API independently
- **Agent Names**: Assigned names (Alice, Bob, Charlie) or default to "Alice"

## Phase Progression

### Phase 1: Research and Domain Understanding
**Guide**: `research-phase-guide.md`
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Deliverables**: Domain analysis, API data samples, business context documentation

### Phase 2: Field and Schema Documentation  
**Guide**: `writing-phase-guide.md`
**Duration**: 3-4 hours
**Deliverables**: Enhanced input/output schemas, endpoint descriptions

### Phase 3: Integration and Cross-References
**Guide**: `integration-phase-guide.md`
**Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Deliverables**: Cross-references, final quality review, completed API documentation

### Phase 4: Editorial Synthesis (Optional)
**Guide**: `editor-workflow-guide.md`
**Duration**: 5-8 hours
**Deliverables**: Synthesized final documentation combining best work from all agents

## File Naming Convention

See `shared-standards.md` for complete file naming conventions and examples.

## Quality Standards

See `shared-standards.md` for complete quality standards, templates, and examples.

### Success Criteria
- 100% field coverage with enhanced descriptions
- Real examples from actual API data
- Cross-references to related endpoints
- Natural, readable language
- Clear business value explanation

## Getting Started

1. **Read this overview** to understand the project structure
2. **Review shared standards**: Read `shared-standards.md` for all common rules and templates
3. **Begin with Phase 1**: Follow `research-phase-guide.md`
4. **Complete phases sequentially**: Do not skip ahead
5. **Show compliance in chat**: No separate markdown files needed

## Large API Strategy

For APIs with >10 endpoints:
1. **Process in batches**: Work on 3-4 endpoints per session
2. **Complete full phase**: Finish research phase for those endpoints before moving to next batch
3. **Continue sequentially**: Move to next batch and repeat
4. **Final integration**: Combine all work in final integration phase

## Support

- **Data fetching issues**: Stop work and request assistance
- **Unclear requirements**: Ask for clarification before proceeding
- **Technical problems**: Escalate rather than work around

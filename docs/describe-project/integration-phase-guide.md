# Integration Phase Guide

## Phase Objective

Add cross-references between endpoints and perform final quality review to create comprehensive, integrated documentation.

## Context Management

- Focus only on cross-reference opportunities
- Reference previous work rather than re-reading everything
- Work systematically through endpoints
- Monitor context usage - if approaching 70%, summarize progress and continue

## Duration
1-2 hours

## Phase Deliverables
- Cross-references added to all relevant endpoint descriptions
- Final quality review completed
- Integration testing performed
- Completed API documentation ready for use

## Cross-Reference Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: All API cross-references **MUST** be explicitly documented **ONLY** within the `endpointDescriptions.[agent-name].json` file for each endpoint, making it the **single source of truth** for integration patterns. Cross-references **MUST NOT** be included in `.describe()` annotations within input or output schema files (e.g., `inputSchemas.ts`, `outputSchemas.ts`).

See `shared-standards.md` for complete cross-reference guidelines, format rules, and required content elements within the `endpointDescriptions.json` narrative string.

### Key Integration Phase Activities
1. Review endpoint relationships from research phase
2. Identify data that could be enhanced by other endpoints
3. Map sequential workflows (A → B → C)
4. Identify complementary data combinations
5. Integrate cross-references naturally into the `endpointDescriptions.json` narrative string (see `shared-standards.md` for format and content requirements).

## Cross-Reference Validation

### Format Requirements
- [ ] Cross-references are integrated naturally into the narrative string within `endpointDescriptions.json`.
- [ ] Use exact endpoint function names (see `shared-standards.md` for format)
- [ ] Verb choice appropriate ("Use with" vs. "Combine with")

### Content Requirements
- [ ] Cross-references are actionable and specific
- [ ] Endpoint combinations make business sense
- [ ] Workflow guidance is clear and helpful
- [ ] Integration opportunities are realistic

## Final Quality Review

Follow `shared-standards.md` for complete quality standards. Key integration phase requirements:

### Content Quality
- [x] All fields documented with enhanced descriptions
- [x] Business context included throughout
- [x] Real-world meaning clear
- [x] Plain English used consistently
- [x] Active voice throughout

### Technical Quality
- [x] Complete coverage of all fields
- [x] Consistent format for similar field types
- [x] Cross-references added where appropriate **within `endpointDescriptions.json`**
- [x] Data accuracy verified
- [x] Integration guidance clear

### Readability Quality
- [x] Natural, conversational language
- [x] Appropriate length for field complexity
- [x] Clear examples that aid understanding
- [x] No technical jargon without explanation
- [x] Consistent terminology throughout

### Business Value
- [x] Real-world applications explained
- [x] Usage guidance provided
- [x] Endpoint relationships documented
- [x] Domain knowledge included
- [x] Practical value clear

## Integration Testing

### Cross-Reference Validation
- [x] All cross-references use correct endpoint names (see `shared-standards.md`)
- [x] Referenced endpoints exist and are accessible
- [x] Integration workflows make business sense
- [x] Cross-references enhance rather than confuse

### Endpoint Relationship Testing
- [x] Sequential workflows are logical
- [x] Data dependencies are clear
- [x] Business processes are supported
- [x] Integration opportunities are realistic

### Documentation Completeness
- [x] All endpoints have enhanced descriptions
- [x] All fields have business context
- [x] All schemas explain purpose and value
- [x] All cross-references are actionable **within `endpointDescriptions.json`**

## Phase Completion Checklist

- [x] Documentation ready for use

## Expected Deliverables

### Updated Files
- `src/apis/[api-name]/working/endpointDescriptions.[agent].json` (with integrated cross-references)
- `src/apis/[api-name]/working/inputSchemas.[agent].ts` (updated with data freshness, if applicable)
- `src/apis/[api-name]/working/outputSchemas.[agent].ts` (updated with data freshness, if applicable)

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive cross-reference coverage **within `endpointDescriptions.json`**
- Final quality review completed
- Integration testing performed
- Documentation ready for production use

## Common Issues

See `shared-standards.md` for complete common issues and solutions. Key integration phase issues:

### Incorrect Endpoint Names
- **Problem**: Using generic names instead of exact function names
- **Solution**: Always use exact endpoint function names from `src/clients/**`

### Embedded Cross-References
- **Problem**: Adding cross-references mid-sentence
- **Solution**: Always add cross-references as separate final sentences

### Non-Actionable Cross-References
- **Problem**: Generic references like "This might be useful for route planning"
- **Solution**: Provide specific, actionable guidance with exact endpoint names

### Missing Integration Opportunities
- **Problem**: Not identifying obvious endpoint relationships
- **Solution**: Review API index and research phase notes for integration opportunities

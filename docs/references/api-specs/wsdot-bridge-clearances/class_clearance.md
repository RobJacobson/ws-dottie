## Detailed Description

Bridge clearance information, see disclaimer

Attention
:   *DISCLAIMER: This Bridge Vertical [Clearance](class_clearance.html "Bridge clearance information, see disclaimer") Trip Planner is a guide for vertical clearances, but because of physical changes to highways and other possible inconsistencies due to natural phenomena (expansion and contraction of highway facilities due to temperature, natural or unnatural material deposition on the pavement, other transient and lasting unforeseen events, etc.), new construction, pavement overlays, lane reconfiguration, etc, it cannot be guaranteed. As stated on all permits in accordance with state law, the operator is responsible to identify, navigate and clear all obstructions. WAC 468-38-070 states it is the responsibility of the permit applicant to check, or prerun, the proposed route and provide for safe maneuvers around the obstruction or detours as necessary. Note that the lane in which the maximum and minimum clearances occur are not listed. This must be determined by the operator. In accordance with state law, the owner or operator of a vehicle or combination of vehicles shall exercise due care in determining that sufficient vertical clearance is provided upon the public highways where the vehicle or combination of vehicles is being operated. Also note that the clearances displayed are approximately three inches less than the actual measured clearances. This adjustment is intended to enhance safety and increase the margin of error for judgments made by highway users hauling oversize loads. For that reason, and due to the variations in structure clearance partially cataloged above, such users should not assume that clearance is in excess of what is published, and should utilize check and prerun methods to assure safe passage.*

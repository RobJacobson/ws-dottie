A temporary pedestrian bridge begins over Alaskan Way begins at First Avenue and Marion Street and continues to the new elevated pedestrian connector and ticketing. From the elevated level you can reach the passenger building.<br>\r\n2. There are three stairways at the south, center and north areas of the new entry building along Alaskan Way. All of these stairs lead to the elevated pedestrian connector for ticketing and access to the terminal building.<br>\r\n3. There are two elevators at Colman Dock:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n• One is at the entry building along Alaskan Way<br>\r\n• The second is adjacent to the Passenger Only Ferry where the King County Water Taxi and Kitsap Fast Ferry terminal are located<br>\r\n• Passenger Pick-Up/Drop Off: The temporary passenger pick-up/drop-off area is located on northbound Alaskan Way between Marion and Madison streets. To view a graphic of the pick-up drop-off area, visit the <a href=\"https://wsdot.wa.gov/construction-planning/search-projects/ferries-seattle-multimodal-terminal-colman-dock-project\">Seattle Multimodal Terminal at Colman Dock Project</a> page and select the “maps & drawings” tab.<br></p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tickets</b><br>\r\n• To save time, you may purchase tickets in advance <a href=\"https://wave2go.wsdot.com/webstore/landingPage?cg=21&c=76\">online</a><br>\r\n• A staffed ticket booth and self-serve kiosks are located in the enclosed walkway that leads into the passenger building. There is an additional self-serve kiosk within the passenger building.<br>\r\n• The staffed ticket booth is the only place to purchase tickets with cash.<br></p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tips for walk-on passengers</b><br>\r\n• There are now over 350 seats available in the completed terminal building. Please arrive about 15 minutes before your scheduled sailing. You’ll also find plenty of seating on the ferry, with accommodations of 1,500 to 2,500 passengers depending on the vessel.<br>\r\n• The only time we approach full walk-on capacity is during major events such as a sports team playoff or series championship games. <br></p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Leaving Colman Dock after disembarking a ferry as a walk-on passenger</b><br>\r\n• There are several ways to travel upon leaving the ferries:<br> \r\n<br>\r\n1. Passengers can cross the elevated pedestrian connector to take stairs or elevators to Alaskan Way.<br>\r\n2. Passengers can travel through the temporary walkway that travels over Alaskan Way to reach Marion Street.<br>\r\n3. Passengers can also travel across the pedestrian bridge that connects to the passenger only ferry that leads to Alaskan Way and Yesler Way. Both stairs and elevators are available to reach ground level.<br></p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<li><b>Bicycles</b><br>\r\n<b>Getting to Colman Dock and onto the ferries</b><br>\r\n• There are designated holding lanes for bicycles going to either Bainbridge Island or Bremerton. Please watch for signs or speak with staff to ensure that you queue in the correct holding lane.<br>\r\n• Bremerton cyclists will enter at the regular vehicle toll booths and queue for slip 1—same as previously.<br>\r\n• Bainbridge cyclists will enter via two options depending on time of day:<br> \r\n<br>\r\n1. There is a dedicated bike entrance with turnstile and covered waiting area that leads to slip 3. This dedicated lane is accessed from Alaskan Way to the north of the Marion Street ext. The bike tollbooth will be open from 3 pm to 7 pm weekdays. There will be an attendant to scan Orca cards or tickets during these hours.<br> \r\n2. Bainbridge bikes will be able to enter from the regular toll booth and ride across the trestle lanes to enter the bike holding lane on the north end of the trestle.<br> \r\n<br>\r\n• For your safety, it is critical that bicycle riders follow all signs and stay in designated holding lanes and bicycle pathways when traveling to and from the ferry. We appreciate your cooperation and patience.<br>\r\n• Bicycles receive priority access to all sailings, and pay the round-trip passenger fare on the Seattle-side at Colman Dock only.<br>\r\n• For general bicycle route information, you can check out the city of Seattle’s <a href=\"https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bike-program/bike-web-map\">bicycle routes map</a>.<br></p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Leaving Colman Dock after disembarking a ferry on a bicycle</b><br>\r\n• Disembark ferry in three separate groups, depending on preference: at the beginning, middle or end of the vehicle offloading process.<br>\r\n• All bicycles will be directed to either the Yesler Way or Marion Street exits depending on construction activities.<br>\r\n• You can access the <a href=\"https://waterfrontseattle.org/waterfront-projects/park-promenade-bike-path\">Waterfront Seattle bike path</a> from either of the Colman Dock exits.<br>  \r\n• Please do not cut across the holding lanes or exit through the toll plaza.<br></p>",

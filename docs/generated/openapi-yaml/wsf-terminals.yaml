Motorcycles should proceed, while on the dock, at no more than 10 mph. Use caution when car decks are wet. The following information details specific staging for this terminal:<p>\r\n<strong>Entry/Staging:</strong><br>\r\nMotorcyclists queue, along with vehicles, in traffic line prior to tollbooths.

                    MotorcycleInfo: "While motorcycles are not, by Washington Administrative Code (WAC 468-300-700), a preferential loading category of users, they are often loaded prior to automobiles for operational and staging purposes. Arrival at the dock after vehicle load has commenced requires motorcycles to wait until all cars have been loaded for the next motorcycle loading opportunity. Motorcycles should proceed, while on the dock, at no more than 10 mph. Use caution when car decks are wet. The following information details specific staging for this terminal:<p>\r\n<b>Motorcycle Fare Purchase/Redemption</b><br>\r\nPurchase tickets at the auto tollbooths, at the kiosk inside the terminal waiting room, or online in advance.<p>\r\n<b>Motorcycle Entry/Staging</b><br>\r\nQueue with automobiles prior to tollbooth. Sales and fare collection occur at tollbooth main window, no transactions through back window. Staging varies by time of day and slip in use, ask the ticket sellers or traffic attendants where to stage.<p>\r\n<b>Motorcycle Loading</b><br>\r\nLoading order: Bicycles, motorcycles, vehicles, late arriving motorcycles as space permits.<br>\r\nDuring commute hours, a motorcycle mid-load may occur.<p>\r\n<b>Motorcycle Special Communication</b><br>\r\nFor motorcycles arriving after vehicle load concludes, space availability will determine ability to board sailing.\r\n"

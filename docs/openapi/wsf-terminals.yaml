Motorcycles should proceed, while on the dock, at no more than 10 mph. Use caution when car decks are wet. The following information details specific staging for this terminal:<p>\r\n<b>Motorcycle Fare Purchase/Redemption</b><br>\r\nPurchase tickets at the auto tollbooths, at the kiosk inside the terminal waiting room, or online in advance.<p>\r\n<b>Motorcycle Entry/Staging</b><br>\r\nQueue with automobiles prior to tollbooth. Sales and fare collection occur at tollbooth main window, no transactions through back window. Staging varies by time of day and slip in use, ask the ticket sellers or traffic attendants where to stage.<p>\r\n<b>Motorcycle Loading</b><br>\r\nLoading order: Bicycles, motorcycles, vehicles, late arriving motorcycles as space permits.<br>\r\nDuring commute hours, a motorcycle mid-load may occur.<p>\r\n<b>Motorcycle Special Communication</b><br>\r\nFor motorcycles arriving after vehicle load concludes, space availability will determine ability to board sailing.\r\n"

                    MotorcycleInfo: "While motorcycles are not, by Washington Administrative Code (WAC 468-300-700), a preferential loading category of users, they are often loaded prior to automobiles for operational and staging purposes. Arrival at the dock after vehicle load has commenced requires motorcycles to wait until all cars have been loaded for the next motorcycle loading opportunity. Motorcycles should proceed, while on the dock, at no more than 10 mph. Use caution when car decks are wet. The following information details specific staging for this terminal:<p> \r\n\r\n<b>Motorcycle Fare Purchase/Redemption</b><br>\r\nTickets are required for International travel to Sidney, B.C. Canada.<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Motorcycle Entry/Staging</b><br>\r\nMotorcycles are staged on the yellow curb lane in front of Cannery Landing.<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Motorcycle Loading</b><br>\r\nLoading order: bicycles, motorcycles, vehicles, late arriving motorcycles as space permits.<p> \r\n\r\n<b>Motorcycle Special Communication</b><br>\r\nRecommended arrival time is 20 minutes prior to scheduled sailing time.<br>\r\nOn high traffic sailings, vessel overloads may occur for travel to Anacortes. To avoid missing a desired sailing, motorcyclists should arrive an hour prior to scheduled sailing.<p>\r\n\r\nInter-island tickets may be used between any two islands, they are not destination specific and fare payment is required traveling westbound only. Motorcyclists travel free eastbound. "
                    TruckInfo: "WSF requires trucks with a gross vehicle weight of over 80,000 lbs and/or over 8’6” wide to have “travel approval” before crossing any of our routes.  Vessels on this route have a limited height clearance and trucks may be loaded out of sequence.<p>\r\nTrucks that have a gross vehicle weight of over 80,000 lbs but are hauling less than 80,000 lbs will need to provide a weight slip.<p>\r\nPlease fill out our <A HREF=\"https://wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/rider-information/trucks\" class=\"content_text\">Oversized/Overweight Vehicle Travel</A> form and email it to wsfinfo@wsdot.wa.gov. Please allow three business days for completion and approval. You can contact us at anytime for status updates at (206)464-6400.</p>\r\n"
                    BikeInfo: Bicyclists load through the passenger terminal and should bypass the vehicle holding lanes. Bicyclists should arrive 20 minutes prior to departure time to be loaded at the beginning of vehicle loading. If a bicyclist arrives after vehicle loading has begun, they will be loaded at the end of the load. The terminal has bicycle racks near the terminal along Front Street.  Bicyclists are asked to walk on and walk off the vessel.  The Agent will notify bicyclists when they may ride while offloading.

                      MotorcycleInfo: "While motorcycles are not, by Washington Administrative Code (WAC 468-300-700), a preferential loading category of users, they are often loaded prior to automobiles for operational and staging purposes. Arrival at the dock after vehicle load has commenced requires motorcycles to wait until all cars have been loaded for the next motorcycle loading opportunity. Motorcycles should proceed, while on the dock, at no more than 10 mph. Use caution when car decks are wet. The following information details specific staging for this terminal:<p>\r\n<strong>Entry/Staging:</strong><br>\r\nMotorcyclists queue, along with vehicles, in traffic line prior to tollbooths. Proceed to motorcycle staging area in front of holding lanes as directed by ticket seller or traffic attendant.<p>\r\n<strong>Loading:</strong><br>\r\nLoading order: bicycles, motorcycles, vehicles, late arriving motorcycles as space permits. \r\nSpace may be limited to 30 motorcycles per sailing.</p>\r\n\r\n"
                      TruckInfo: "Expect heavy truck traffic on the first 3 sailings in the morning. Trucks going standby are advised to travel between the 7:40 am to 11:00 am time frame.<p>WSF requires trucks with a gross vehicle weight of over 80,000 lbs and/or over 8’6” wide to have “travel approval” before crossing any of our routes.  Vessels on this route have a limited height clearance and trucks may be loaded out of sequence.<p>\r\nTrucks that have a gross vehicle weight of over 80,000 lbs but are hauling less than 80,000 lbs will need to provide a weight slip.<p>\r\nPlease fill out our <A HREF=\"https://wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/rider-information/trucks\" class=\"content_text\">Oversized/Overweight Vehicle Travel</A> form and email it to wsfinfo@wsdot.wa.gov. Please allow three business days for completion and approval.

                      BikeInfo: "Approaching the Anacortes Terminal, you will arrive at the vehicle tollbooths first on the right. Bicyclists may bypass these and the line of vehicle traffic at the vehicle tollbooths to get onto the ferry dock when the passenger tollbooth in the terminal is open, but must go through a vehicle tollbooth if the terminal and passenger tollbooth are closed. Signage at the vehicle tollbooth will indicate if the passenger tollbooth is open. If passenger booth is open, bicyclists should secure their bikes at the terminal and go into the terminal to purchase their tickets.<p>\r\nThere is one bike rack at the terminal which holds 12 bikes. Bicyclists should arrive 20 minutes prior to departure time to be loaded at the beginning of loading process to be certain they are loaded for their specific destination and multi-destination sailings. If a bicyclist arrives after vehicle loading has begun, they may not be loaded for their desired destination.</p>"

                      MotorcycleInfo: "While motorcycles are not, by Washington Administrative Code (WAC 468-300-700), a preferential loading category of users, they are often loaded prior to automobiles for operational and staging purposes. Arrival at the dock after vehicle load has commenced requires motorcycles to wait until all cars have been loaded for the next motorcycle loading opportunity. Motorcycles should proceed, while on the dock, at no more than 10 mph. Use caution when car decks are wet. The following information details specific staging for this terminal:<p>\r\n<strong>Entry/Staging:</strong><br>\r\nMotorcyclists queue, along with vehicles, in traffic line prior to tollbooths. Proceed to motorcycle staging area in front of holding lanes as directed by ticket seller or traffic attendant.<p>\r\n<strong>Loading:</strong><br>\r\nLoading order: bicycles, motorcycles, vehicles, late arriving motorcycles as space permits. \r\nSpace may be limited to 30 motorcycles per sailing.</p>\r\n\r\n"

                      BikeInfo: "Approaching the Anacortes Terminal, you will arrive at the vehicle tollbooths first on the right. Bicyclists may bypass these and the line of vehicle traffic at the vehicle tollbooths to get onto the ferry dock when the passenger tollbooth in the terminal is open, but must go through a vehicle tollbooth if the terminal and passenger tollbooth are closed. Signage at the vehicle tollbooth will indicate if the passenger tollbooth is open. If passenger booth is open, bicyclists should secure their bikes at the terminal and go into the terminal to purchase their tickets.<p>\r\nThere is one bike rack at the terminal which holds 12 bikes. Bicyclists should arrive 20 minutes prior to departure time to be loaded at the beginning of loading process to be certain they are loaded for their specific destination and multi-destination sailings.

> **Task**: Refactor the documentation for the specified API and endpoint group and then produce an evaluation report.  
> **Primary instructions**:  
> - Read and follow `misc/documentation-update/api-docs-structure-report.md` for the overall documentation model (Proposal B).  
> - Read and follow `misc/documentation-update/comment-refactoring.md` as the canonical style and process guide (sources hierarchy, field patterns, length limits, etc.).D  
> - Use `misc/documentation-update/wsdot-border-crossings-doc-refactor-agent.md` as your step‑by‑step brief for this API (group/endpoint/schema changes, checklist, and validation plan).  
> **Work product**:  
> 1. Update all of the specified endpoint groups, endpoints, and schemas in `src/apis/wsdot-border-crossings/` to match Proposal B and the patterns in `comment-refactoring.md`. Do not go beyond the scope of the assigned API and endpoints groups.  
> 2. Write an evaluation report that scores your changes against the criteria in the brief (structure, content quality, consistency, agent‑friendliness) and notes any recommended improvements to the instructions themselves.

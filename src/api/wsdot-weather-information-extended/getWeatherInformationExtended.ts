/**
 * Get extended weather information from WSDOT Weather Information Extended API
 *
 * Retrieves additional weather readings including surface and subsurface
 * measurements from WSDOT weather stations.
 *
 * @param params - No parameters required (empty object for consistency)
 * @returns Promise containing extended weather readings data
 * @throws {Error} When the API request fails or validation fails
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const weatherReadings = await getWeatherInformationExtended({});
 * console.log(weatherReadings[0].AirTemperature); // 15.5
 * ```
 *
 * @note ENDPOINT DISCREPANCY: Official WSDOT documentation shows endpoint as
 * `/api/Scanweb`, but the actual working endpoint is `/traffic/api/api/Scanweb`.
 * The documented endpoint returns HTML (not functional), while the current
 * endpoint works correctly and returns the expected JSON data. This appears
 * to be a documentation issue rather than an implementation issue.

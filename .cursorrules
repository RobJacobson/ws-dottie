# Conventional Commits Rule

When generating commit messages, always follow the Conventional Commits specification:
- Use one of these types: feat, fix, build, chore, ci, docs, style, test, perf, refactor, revert
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Subject should be lowercase, under 60 characters, and written in present tense
- Optional body and footer sections for detailed explanations

Examples:
- `feat(api): add new endpoint for weather readings`
- `fix(types): correct return type for vessel stats`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
- `refactor(utils): simplify error handling logic`

# Git Commit Message Guidelines

When generating commit messages, follow these rules:

## Format
Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`

## Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Scope
Include relevant scope in parentheses:
- `(api)`: API-related changes
- `(validation)`: Validation logic
- `(config)`: Configuration changes
- `(shared)`: Shared utilities
- `(docs)`: Documentation

## Description
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Be specific about what changed

## Body
For complex changes, add a body with:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Files affected

Meet Dottie — not just another API wrapper, but your cheerful, unauthorized guide to real-time Washington State transportation data published by the Department of Transportation and Washington State Ferries. Whether you're tracking ferries across Puget Sound or monitoring traffic on I‑5, Dottie makes it feel like you're chatting with a knowledgeable friend who happens to have real‑time access to every traffic camera, weather station, and ferry terminal in the state.

This friendly TypeScript client library provides type‑safe data fetching from 16 Washington State transportation APIs, spanning 89 documented endpoints — from real‑time ferry locations to traffic cameras, weather stations, and highway alerts. Whether you're building a weekend project, a classroom demo, or a production app, WS‑Dottie helps you tame the data firehose with smart caching, strict typing, automatic JSONP in browsers (to dodge CORS roadblocks), and seamless TanStack Query integration — all free and easy to use.

Why folks love WS‑Dottie:
- Fun, friendly DX with strong TypeScript types
- Works great for education, hobbyist builds, and commercial apps
- Sensible defaults you can override with standard TanStack Query options

### Zod‑powered validation (Zod 4)

WS‑Dottie uses Zod 4 schemas for runtime validation and type inference across all APIs. That means:
- Strong, generated TypeScript types from a single source of truth
- Early detection of upstream shape drifts and edge cases
- Safe transformations of date strings and nullable fields
- Pass‑through philosophy for unknown fields (we don’t strip upstream data)

Practically, API functions fetch raw data, validate and transform it with Zod, and then return fully typed results. This improves reliability without adding complexity to your app code.

## ✨ What You Can Build

- **🚢 Ferry Tracking Apps** - Real-time vessel locations, terminal wait times, and sailing schedules
- **🚗 Traffic Monitoring Dashboards** - Live traffic flow, travel times, and highway alerts
- **🌤️ Weather & Road Condition Apps** - Weather station data and mountain pass conditions
- **📷 Camera Feeds** - Access to hundreds of traffic cameras across Washington
- **💰 Toll Rate Calculators** - Real-time toll pricing for planning trips
- **🚛 Commercial Vehicle Tools** - Bridge clearances and vehicle restrictions
- **🌉 Border Crossing Apps** - Wait times and conditions at border crossings

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Free API Key

Visit the [WSDOT Developer Portal](https://wsdot.wa.gov/developers/api-access) and sign up with just your email address. No credit card required — the API is completely free.

### 2. Install WS-Dottie

```bash
npm install ws-dottie
```

### 3. Configure Your API Key

**Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended)**
```bash
# For Node.js applications
export WSDOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
```

**Using a .env file**
```env
WSDOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
```

**Option B: Runtime Configuration**

For dynamic environments or when you need to configure at runtime:

```javascript
import { configManager } from 'ws-dottie';

// Set API key only (recommended for web clients)
configManager.setApiKey('your_api_key_here');

// Set base URL only (optional: route through proxy)
configManager.setBaseUrl('https://your-proxy-server.com');
```

### 4. Module Format Support

WS‑Dottie supports both CommonJS and ES Module formats:

**ES Modules (Recommended)**
```javascript
import { useVesselLocations, useHighwayAlerts, configManager } from 'ws-dottie';
```

**CommonJS**
```javascript
const { useVesselLocations, useHighwayAlerts, configManager } = require('ws-dottie');
```

Modern bundlers and Node.js will choose the optimal format automatically. Deep subpath imports are not currently exposed; prefer named imports.

### 5. Start Building

**Node.js Application**
```javascript
import { WsfVessels, WsdotHighwayAlerts } from 'ws-dottie';

// Get real-time ferry locations
const vessels = await WsfVessels.getVesselLocations();
console.log(`Found ${vessels.length} active vessels`);

// Get current highway alerts
const alerts = await WsdotHighwayAlerts.getHighwayAlerts();
console.log(`Found ${alerts.length} active alerts`);
```

**React Application**
```javascript
import { useVesselLocations, useHighwayAlerts } from 'ws-dottie';

function TransportationDashboard() {
  const { data: vessels, isLoading } = useVesselLocations();
  const { data: alerts } = useHighwayAlerts();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Active Ferries: {vessels?.length || 0}</h2>
      <h2>Highway Alerts: {alerts?.length || 0}</h2>
      {isLoading && <div>Loading...</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🖥️ Command Line Interface

WS-Dottie includes a powerful CLI for quick testing, debugging, and production use cases. Access all transportation data directly from your terminal without writing code.

### Installation

The CLI is included with WS-Dottie and works in Node.js environments:

```bash
# Install ws-dottie (includes CLI)
npm install ws-dottie

# Or use directly with npx (no installation required)
npx ws-dottie --help
```

### Configuration

Set your WSDOT API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export WSDOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
```

### Usage

```bash
ws-dottie <function-name> [params] [--pretty=false]
```

### Examples

**Get border crossing data:**
```bash
ws-dottie getBorderCrossings
```

**Get bridge clearances with parameters:**
```bash
ws-dottie getBridgeClearances '{"route": "005"}'
```

**Get ferry fare information:**
```bash
ws-dottie getFareLineItems '{"originTerminalId": 7, "destinationTerminalId": 3, "date": "2025-01-27"}'
```

**Get raw (unformatted) JSON output:**
```bash
ws-dottie getBorderCrossings --raw
```

### Available Functions

The CLI supports all 89+ endpoints across 16 APIs:

- **WSDOT APIs**: Border Crossings, Bridge Clearances, Highway Alerts, Traffic Cameras, Weather Stations, Travel Times, Toll Rates, Mountain Passes, Commercial Vehicle Restrictions
- **WSF APIs**: Ferry Schedules, Vessel Locations, Terminal Information, Fare Data

Use `ws-dottie --help` to see all available functions with descriptions.

### Pretty Printing

By default, JSON output is formatted with 2-space indentation for readability. Use `--raw` or `--pretty=false` for compact output:

```bash
# Pretty-printed (default)
ws-dottie getBorderCrossings

# Raw JSON
ws-dottie getBorderCrossings --raw
```

### Parameter Validation

The CLI validates parameters against the expected schema for each function, providing clear error messages when parameters are missing or invalid:

```bash
# This will show parameter validation errors
ws-dottie getBridgeClearances '{"invalid": "parameter"}'
```

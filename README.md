> **Say hello to Dottie, your friendly TypeScript companion for Washington State transportation APIs**

Meet Dottie - she's not just another API wrapper, she's your cheerful guide through Washington State's transportation data jungle. Whether you're tracking ferries across Puget Sound or monitoring traffic on I-5, Dottie makes it feel like you're chatting with a knowledgeable friend who happens to have real-time access to every traffic camera, weather station, and ferry terminal in the state. 

This delightful TypeScript client library provides easy access to Washington State's rich transportation data - from real-time ferry locations to traffic cameras, weather stations, and highway alerts. Whether you're building a hobby project to track your daily commute or developing enterprise applications for transportation planning, WS-Dottie gives you a safe, reliable way to tap into this data firehose with smart caching, strict typing, automatic JSONP data fetching in browser environments to avoid CORS concerns, and seamless React Query integration.

## ‚ú® What You Can Build

- **üö¢ Ferry Tracking Apps** - Real-time vessel locations, terminal wait times, and sailing schedules
- **üöó Traffic Monitoring Dashboards** - Live traffic flow, travel times, and highway alerts
- **üå§Ô∏è Weather & Road Condition Apps** - Weather station data and mountain pass conditions
- **üì∑ Camera Feeds** - Access to hundreds of traffic cameras across Washington
- **üí∞ Toll Rate Calculators** - Real-time toll pricing for planning trips
- **üöõ Commercial Vehicle Tools** - Bridge clearances and vehicle restrictions
- **üåâ Border Crossing Apps** - Wait times and conditions at border crossings

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Free API Key

Visit the [WSDOT Developer Portal](https://wsdot.wa.gov/developers/api-access) and sign up with just your email address. No credit card required - the API is completely free.

### 2. Install WS-Dottie

```bash
npm install ws-dottie
```

### 3. Configure Your API Key

**Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended)**
```bash
# For Node.js applications
export WSDOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_api_key_here

# For React/Expo applications
export EXPO_PUBLIC_WSDOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
```

**Option B: Runtime Configuration**
```javascript
import { configManager } from 'ws-dottie';

// Configure at runtime (useful for dynamic environments)
configManager.setConfig({
  WSDOT_ACCESS_TOKEN: 'your_api_key_here',
  WSDOT_BASE_URL: 'https://your-proxy-server.com' // Optional: route through proxy
});
```

### 4. Start Building

**Node.js Application**
```javascript
import { WsfVessels, WsdotHighwayAlerts } from 'ws-dottie';

// Get real-time ferry locations
const vessels = await WsfVessels.getVesselLocations();
console.log(`Found ${vessels.length} active vessels`);

// Get current highway alerts
const alerts = await WsdotHighwayAlerts.getHighwayAlerts();
console.log(`Found ${alerts.length} active alerts`);
```

**React Application**
```javascript
import { useVesselLocations, useHighwayAlerts } from 'ws-dottie';

function TransportationDashboard() {
  const { data: vessels, isLoading } = useVesselLocations();
  const { data: alerts } = useHighwayAlerts();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Active Ferries: {vessels?.length || 0}</h2>
      <h2>Highway Alerts: {alerts?.length || 0}</h2>
      {isLoading && <div>Loading...</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```
